# Linux System Enumeration
This consists of finding interesting information and potential vulnerabilities on a Linux system.

## OS Specific Information
Find the specific OS distribution by reading /etc/issue or release
```bash
cat /etc/issue
#or
cat /etc/lsb-release #Debian
cat /etc/redhat-release #Redhat
```
### Kernel Version
```bash
cat /proc/version
#or
uname -a
```
### Network Interface
Looking at where the system is on a network is valuable as it can potentially lead to lateral movement throughout the network.
```bash
/sbin/ifconig -a
#or
cat /etc/network/interfaces
```
### ARP and MAC Information
Finding what other systems are known on a network without performing any internal network reconnaissance is a great way to stay undetected.
```bash
arp -a
#or
route
```
#### Known Hosts
Finding specific hosts known in a network provides valuable information about high valued systems in a network.
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
### Environment Variables
```bash
cat /etc/profile
#or
cat /etc/bashrc
#or
env
```
## Running Services
```bash
ps aux
#or
cat /etc/services
```
### Services Running as Root
```bash
ps aux | grep root
```
### Services Information
Most service configuration files are located in either /etc or /opt

## Crontabs
```bash
crontab -l
#or
cat /etc/crontab
```
## Sudo Related Enumeration
See if it is possible to run anything as root without having to authenticate
```bash
sudo -l
```
Reading the sudoers file can show who has the permission to use sudo
```bash
cat /etc/sudoers
```
## Group Enumeration
Finding what available groups are on a system can show potential vulnerabilities of a user having to many privileges
```bash
cat /etc/group
```
## User History
Finding out what a user has done before access was received can reveal sensitive information
```bash
cat ~/.bash_history
cat ~/.nano_history
cat ~/.atftp_history
cat ~/.mysql_history
cat ~/.php_history
```
## Log Files
Being able to quickly parse through log files can reveal used usernames, passwords, URLs, etc.
```bash
cat /etc/httpd/logs/*.log
cat /var/log/apache2/*.log
cat /var/log/auth.log
cat /var/log/syslog
```
## Mounted and Unmounted File Systems
```bash
mount
#or
df -h
#or
cat /etc/fstab
```
## Automated Enumeration
Running automated enumeration scripts can be noisy to a system and might lead to an attacker being discovered so use it as a last resort if nothing useful was found from the above sections.
